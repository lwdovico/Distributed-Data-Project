This entire work was done uniquely through the Apache Spark framework by using Python.

A full end-to-end Machine Learning project
has been developed with the usage of the most mainstream
classifiers taken from the literature: Decision Tree, Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine. After
a complete EDA section, all of the above classifiers have been
applied in order to get better results by applying different preprocessing techniques, such as various Features selections, Outlier
detection & removal methods, and the Balancing techniques in
order to tune the best possible models.
A PCA representation has also been used in section 3 to
underline intrinsic relationships among classes and variables, even
though it failed in its scope, and, finally, a geospatial
task has been developed for better completeness.
