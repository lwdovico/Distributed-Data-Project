This entire work was done uniquely through the Apache Spark framework by using Python.

A full end-to-end Machine Learning project has been developed with the usage of the most mainstream
classifiers taken from the literature: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine. 
After a complete EDA section, all of the above classifiers have been applied in order to get better results by applying different preprocessing techniques, 
such as various Features selections, Outlier detection, and Balancing techniques in order to tune the best possible models.
A PCA representation has also been used in section 3 to underline intrinsic relationships among classes and variables, even
though it failed in its scope. Finally, we also executed a geospatial task.
